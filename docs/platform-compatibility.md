# Platform Compatibility

Every model or client uses the same skill implementation: the selected skill's `SKILL.md` plus its bundled resources. Root-level compatibility files exist only as discovery entrypoints and should stay short.

## Shared Workflow

1. Read the root `AGENTS.md` for repository rules.
2. Choose a skill from `docs/skill-index.md`.
3. Read the selected `SKILL.md` completely.
4. Load linked scripts, references, assets, or templates only when required.
5. Preserve the skill workflow and report the verification performed.

Direct invocation pattern:

```text
Read AGENTS.md, then read <skill-path>/SKILL.md, and follow that skill for this task.
```

## Codex

- Uses `AGENTS.md` for repository instructions.
- May discover a skill through `SKILL.md` and optional `agents/openai.yaml` UI metadata.
- Treats `SKILL.md` as the workflow source of truth.

## Claude

- Starts from `CLAUDE.md`, then follows `AGENTS.md` and the selected `SKILL.md`.
- Can ignore `agents/openai.yaml` unless cross-platform metadata is relevant.

## Gemini

- Starts from `GEMINI.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
- Translates PowerShell commands to the current shell when necessary while preserving behavior.
- Inspects bundled script arguments before execution.

## GLM

- Starts from `GLM.md`.
- When automatic skill discovery is unavailable, explicitly selects a path from `docs/skill-index.md` and reads its `SKILL.md`.

## Root Entrypoints

The following files remain in the repository root because clients look for them there:

- `README.md`: human-facing repository landing page.
- `AGENTS.md`: shared agent instructions.
- `CLAUDE.md`: Claude discovery entrypoint.
- `GEMINI.md`: Gemini discovery entrypoint.
- `GLM.md`: GLM discovery entrypoint.

Do not move these files into `docs/`; move detailed explanations here instead.
